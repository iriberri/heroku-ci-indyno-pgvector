# heroku-ci-indyno-pgvector

Note: The `requirements.txt` file is simply a dummy file for Heroku CI to run for the Python buildpack as in the sample `app.json`, as otherwise this is an empty app. Only the pgvector installation script and the `test-setup` step are relevant for pgvector installation through Heroku CI to be used with Postgres in-dyno.
